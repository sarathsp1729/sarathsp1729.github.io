      **Input Output Convex Neural Networks (IOC-NNs) for improved generalization performance**        
      * *                                                                                           * *
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

    -    Proposed a method to constrain output of NNs as convex function
        of its inputs, whilst retaining adequate capacity

    -    IOC-NNs self regularize and give significant reduction in
        empirical error, reducing the risk of over-fitting

    -    Demonstrated IOC-NNs' robustness to label noise and improvement
        in confidence calibration of the network

    -    IOC constraint improves test performance for MLPs and gives
        competitive performance on CNN architectures

      * *                                                                                        * *
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

    -    Proposed a training protocol which gives SOTA performance on
        four standard DG benchmarks

    -    A simple ERM with a chosen backbone (chosen from ablation
        study) outperforms methods tailored for DG

    -    Proposed an alternate evaluation framework (ClasswiseDG) where,
        a domain from each class is kept out for testing

    -    Despite being exposed to all the domains during training, NNs
        find it challenging perform in this framework

        hinge on emotion from a human interpretable space

    -    Used Speaker discriminative embedding to attend on phonemes to
        scale TTS to multiple speakers

-   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
      **Behaviour aware conversational BoT: variance scaling from emotion cues**        
      * *                                                                            * *
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

    -    Modelled response of an agent in a conversation with
        'behaviour' as the apparent and 'emotion' as a latent state

    -    Improved our TTS model using differential scaling of variance
        in the direction of predicted emotion

    -    Showed that the a change in initial state of an agent can cause
        large variation in trail of emotions in the dialogue
