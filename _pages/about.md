I am a PhD student at the CISPA â€“ Helmholtz Center for Information Security (Germany). I am working with Prof. [Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) analysing the pitfalls of training ML models under closed world assumptions. Our earlier work was on Out-Of-Distribution generalization and currently we are focused on anomaly detection for neural networks. Previously, I did my masters at International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad with research at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). I worked with Prof. [Vineet Gandhi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/). My thesis work was centered around understanding the generalization of neural networks under both IID assumptions and distribution shifts. I also worked with Tata Research Development and Design Center (TRDDC), Pune. My work with TRDDC is at the intersection of Multimedia, AI, and Behavioural Science.
