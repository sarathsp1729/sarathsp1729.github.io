I am a graduate student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad pursuing my master’s degree with research at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). I work with Prof. [Vineet Gandhi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/). My thesis work is centered around understanding the generalization of neural networks. I also work in collaboration with Tata Research Development and Design Center (TRDDC), Pune. My work with TRDDC is at the intersection of Multimedia, AI, and Behavioural Science. Earlier I have worked with TCS Innovation Labs, Trivandrum and Humanitarian Technology Labs at Amrita, Kollam.
